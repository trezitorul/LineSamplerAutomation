This is my first attempt to play with repos.

So essentially, the branch system allows me to play with my files before I have to commit them finally.

This is great since I often want to try a method but will often find that the way I have implemented it is not satisfactory and thus 
I need to delete most of it. I should practice making many many many branches and just merging them with the master constantly.
